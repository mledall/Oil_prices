The question this repository is asking:

What will the price of oil be on Friday, Nov. 16th, 2018?

This repository contains the following files:

- The data: DCOILWTICO.csv, containing 35 years of the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil prices. The WTI is a crude grade of oil, mostly traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX). It is often used as a benchmark for oil prices.

- A Jupyter Notebook: Scotiabank_datachallenge_Matthias_LeDall.ipynb, which details my approach, explores the data and draws my predictions.

- My script: oil_prices.py, a python script containing all the functions necessary to answer this question.

- My pipeline: oil_prices_pipeline.py, a python script that takes as input the raw data and outputs the predictions, along with plots of the data, by making use of the functions in oil_prices.py.
